Why Wahoo?
=============
Wahoo was created because I find the effects that Yahoo created in their Weather app stunning. Because of this, I'm are looking at how they pulled them off and am trying to replicate the effects in Xamarin.iOS. And maybe, if I'm lucky, I can learn something about UI design and the possibilities the platform offers along the way. Wahoo is up here on Github to share what I've found and hopefully stimulate other people to participate in its development.

So, what does it do?
=============
Currently Wahoo is a rather simple set of classes that replicates (part of) the Yahoo Weather experience. No code-optimization, performance enhancements, code-reusability and manymore of those buzzwords has been applied as of yet. It's just a brute force attempt to replicate the effects. In a nutshell, the following effects can be found in the Yahoo Weather app that we are trying to replicate:

* Slow parallax and fade effect when scrolling vertically (mimicked in Wahoo, but might need some finetuning)
* Fading content below the application header (also mimicked in Wahoo)
* Header tap resets the scrolling (partially done in Wahoo)
* Synchronous scrolling between the pages (not yet created in Wahoo)
* Horizontal parallax effect (not yet created in Wahoo)

And what can I do?
-------------
This is one of my first Xamarin.iOS projects, so I'm more then aware of the fact that it can be optimized in many, many ways. That is where your knowledge can come in handy. If you have ideas, additions, improvements etc. you are more then welcome to share them. Check below for a short video of what the current version of Wahoo has to offer.
